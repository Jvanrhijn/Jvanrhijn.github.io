title: Quantum Monte Carlo Primer
---

This post is the first in a series of blog posts detailing my experiences developing a quantum Monte Carlo library in Rust. This first entry serves as an introduction to quantum Monte Carlo methods, and a little bit of quantum mechanics itself, hopefully in a way that is understandable to the average programmer.

This is an equation:

$$
  \hat{H}\psi = E\psi
$$
